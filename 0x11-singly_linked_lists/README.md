##Introduction to linked lists  
This directory marks the first time we encounter linked lists. All functions here are about singly linked lists, the structure of which is given in `lists.h`.  All functions prototypes are given.   
The following exercises are answered:  
0. Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.  
1. Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.  
2. Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list. It must return the address og the new node upon success or `NULL`, the value of the node, a string must be copied.  
3. Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list. It must return the address og the new node upon success or `NULL`, the value of the node, a string must be copied.  
4. Write a function that free a list_t list. We must free all we have malloc'ed before.
  
The following questions are extras, not related to linked lists.  
100. Write a function that prints a specific string before the main function is executed.  
101. Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line. We are only allowed to use the printf function.
