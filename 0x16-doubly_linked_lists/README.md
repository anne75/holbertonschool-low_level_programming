# Doubly linked list in C
This project evolves around the manipulation of a doubly linked list of ints in C. The struct is given in the header file.   
The following problems were solved:  

0. Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.  
1. Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.  
2. Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.  
3. Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.  
4. Write a function that free a dlistint_t list.  
5. Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.  
6. Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.  
7. Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.  
8. Write a function that deletes the node at a given index of a dlistint_t linked list.  
9. Solve a crackme challenge, a executable is given, find the password.  
10. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.  
11. Write a password generator for crackme5.
