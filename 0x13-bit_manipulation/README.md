### Bit Manipulation
This folder contains our first encounter with bits. The following questions were asked:  
0. Write a function that converts a string containing a binary number to an unsigned int. Return either the number or 0 on error.  
1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number. The number is an `unsigned long int`. We are not allowed to use malloc, arrays, `/` or `%`.  
2. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index (index starting from the least significant bit).  
3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.  
4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.  
5. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.  
6. Write a function that checks the endianness.  
Last questions are about finding a password for a file given in object code, and writing a post about [two's complement](https://medium.com/@anne75/twos-complement-679c0e60c4b2#.aauivadq8).
